	   <b><p>Life Without Limits by Nick Vujicic</p></b>
      <p>There are certain books that move you from inside and then there are books that help you move your
	  problems from inside. 'Life Without Limits' privileges<span id="dots2">...</span><span id="more2">
	   to fall in both the categories. The mere 
	  thought of imagining yourself in place of the author, a person born without arms or legs, can 
	  leave you in a dark zone of mind where you don't even know what will you do. Yet this author 
	  stands as the central character of his book where he tells the story of his physical 
	  disabilities and the emotional battles he endured while learning to deal with them as a child,
	  teen and a young adult. But what is he today? 
NICK VUJICIC is an international and New York Times best-selling author, evangelist, and 
most prominently, a motivational speaker. In 'Life Without Limits', Nick talks about the 
struggles he faced since childhood, and how it took him years to even accept the disabilities 
he was born with. He walks us through the hardest times of his childhood and casts light on 
the unique challenges that a person like him faces. But all this for what? To gain sympathy? Never. 
Through these hardships, Nick inspires you to shatter your own limits that life, or you have 
placed upon yourself. He motivates you to think that if a person with such disabilities 
can prosper in life then why can't you? He keeps asking the readers to think about, 
"What would your life be like if anything were possible?" He eagerly spreads his 
central message: The most important goal is to find your life's purpose and to never give up,
 despite whatever difficulties or seemingly impossible odds stand in your way. Every chapter of 
 the book will have your inner spirit rise up a level, and subtly, you will learn to find a way 
 to fight your problems and grow through each one of them.
A must read for anyone struggling to find the purpose of their lives. 
Let Nick inspire you to start living your own life without limits.

	   <b><p>The Hunger Games Trilogy by Suzanne Collins</p></b>
      <p>The Hunger Games Trilogy is a series of 3 young adult novels written with an excellent choice 
	  of words, grasping story and <span id="dots8">...</span><span id="more8">
	  conviction which transports the reader to an actual Hunger Games world. The novels in the trilogy are
	  The Hunger Games (2008), Catching Fire (2009), and Mockingjay (2010).
The novels are based in the Hunger Games Universe, an apocalyptic world, consisting of the wealthy Capitol 
and 13 districts in varying states of poverty. Each year, the first 12 districts have to send their children 
to participate in a compulsory televised battle death match called The Hunger Games. The protagonist, 
Katniss Everdeen, lives in District 12, the poorest area of Panem, where people die of hunger on a daily basis.
 The novels are based on how ‘Hunger Games’ destroys Katniss’ and her loved ones’ lives when her sister is
 selected to participate in the games, for whom she volunteers. The first novel involves her journey through 
 the games, the second one is based on the aftermath of the previous games where she had defied the Capitol 
 and won the competition along with her partner and the third novel is based on how she motivates people from 
 all districts to revolt against the Capitol to end an everlasting era of oppression and domination. 
It is a nail biting, extremely thought-provoking and exciting book which keeps you on the edge and leaves 
you guessing what is going to happen next, a must read for fiction lovers! Suzanne Collins has definitely 
outdone herself with this trilogy and a very recent addition of the trilogy’s sequel 
‘The Ballad of Songbirds and Snakes’.

	  <b><p>The Hate U Give by Angie Thomas</p></b>
      <p>To summarize the story I think the simplest 
	  slogan I could use is "Black Lives Matter", released before the quote became a global movement
	  that <span id="dots5">...</span><span id="more5">questioned racism in all its forms, “The Hate U give“ came with a much more direct and 
	  heartfelt perspective into what it actually feels like to be a witness and victim of police 
	  brutality due to race/colour of skin.
The protagonist of this young adult story is a very real sixteen-year-old girl who was just trying
 to juggle her two lives; one as part of her hood where she could be who she truly was and the other 
 in her all-white high school where she was one of them. So, when her childhood best friend is shot
 to death by a white police officer for ‘doing nothing’ her life comes tumbling down to the reality 
 of what it actually is like to be a ‘Black Person’.
Her story for justice is a real one rather than heroic as she herself stumbles to find the courage 
to fight, but it moves us all to see the reality of the so called 21st century America and the
 root for why ‘Black Lives Matter’ wasn’t just a simple quote or hashtag but a global awakening 
 call to all still bound by ideas of race and white supremacy.

	  know about the fashion visionary, designer's innovation and companies who
	  are crafting the future of sustainable technologies to redefine fashion. One of the most easy yet time-consuming

	  to resist the fast fasion, as it is exploiting the right amount and quality, she also talk about the 
	  vast amount of production at a lightning speed and then delivered to customers at a vague prospect. 
	  It's alarming and one should reassess the fashion with broad perspective, from it's production, to design, to
environemnt and quality.

	   <b><p>Right Ho Jeeves by PG Wodehouse</p></b>
      <p>‘What ho what ho what ho’ that’s the style of Bertie Wooster,
	  just another marvellous creation by PG Wodehouse.<span id="dots3">...</span><span id="more3">
	   Right ho Jeeves one of the finest books I could ever lay my hands on, the portrayal of a rich 
	   English gentlemen whose penchant is to fall into trouble in numerous occasions always to be 
	   rescued by his valet. Right Ho Jeeves set in the Brinkley manor the stately home of his aunt 
	   Dahlia  who as described by Wooster carefully fixed coiffure" . 
Bertram (Bertie) Wooster spent a lovely holiday in Cannes. Upon his return, he had the misfortune 
to stumble straight into the following mess: a couple engaged to split up a couple in love with 
each other but because of their... Yeah, hmm. The peculiarities (yes, this is the best word) are 
unable to accept their feelings.
"I have no doubt that by the hour, you could have flung bricks in England's most densely populated 
districts without endangering the safety of a single girl capable of becoming Mrs. 
Augustus Fink-Nottle without anaesthetics."
Add to this the failure of his aunt Dahila’s to get money from her husband for her magazine to 
replace her gambling loss, the need to make a speech for Market Snodsbury Grammar School awards, 
the resignation of Aunt Dahlia's brilliant chief Anatole-and you will begin to get a glimpse of
the insurmountable difficulties that Bertie was facing. Like a true warrior, he charged headlong
 through all the troubles trying to untangle them. It was easy to guess the outcome of his efforts, 
 but you can trust Wodehouse to come up with the most amusing ones all the time. In other words, 
 the more Bertie tried the worse the mess got.
A quote from the book which never fails to amuse me 
“Jeeves, I'm engaged."
"I hope you will be very happy, sir."
"Don't be an ass. I'm engaged to Miss Bassett.”
I have read books in the series each and everyone has impressed me however this book is my 
favourite as the portrayal of Gussie fink nottle and Madeline Basset really tingle my bones.

	  <b><p>A Tale of Two Cities by Charles Dickens</p></b>
      <p>One of the best ever published novels. I've never seen a ranking that this novel didn't have. If you've ever
	  <span id="dots6">...</span><span id="more6">
	  wondered what it would be like to live through the French Revolution, read this book. You feel the rage,
	  the hopelessness, the vulnerability, and most of all, the fear that enveloped everyone through Dickens'
	  words. Reading this masterpiece was a joy and a privilege.I instantly decided after reading this that 
	  I would plan to read the remaining Dickens books . I was completely fascinated by his characters who 
	  came to life for me immediately and whose hopes and fears I found myself really caring for. Equally 
	  amazing was the plotting and overall story-telling skill of Dickens that I felt was masterful. Dickens 
	  writing conveyed the passions and turmoil of the French Revolution.
	  It was an era of great change and great danger at the time of the French Revolution. It was a time when 
	  a thirst for revenge encountered injustice, and never was a distinction made between the innocent and 
	  the guilty. Dickens' great tale of unsurpassed adventure and bravery unfolds against this turbulent 
	  historical background. Dr. Alexandre Manette, unjustly imprisoned for 18 years in the Bastille, is 
	  reunited with his daughter, Lucie, and transported safely from France to England.It would seem that 
	  in peace they could pick up the threads of their lives. However as luck would have it, the pair are 
	  called to the Old Bailey to testify against a young Frenchman wrongly accused of treason, Charles Darnay.
	  Oddly enough, Darnay bears an uncanny similarity to another man in the courtroom, Sydney Carton, 
	  the dissolute lawyer's clerk. It is a coincidence that saves Darnay more than once from certain doom.
	  The book is beautifully plotted and rich in suspense, romance, and heroism  that culminate in a daring 
	  prison escape in the shadow of the guillotine.

Well I'm not a bookish person who loves to read. But this book is something else.A person who has never

So let me be clear when you start reading this book you feel like you've  entered a different world. 
Each and everything that happens in the book you feel like you're present there. Personally I am very 
pleased by the way the author writes.
When you start reading this book you also start to develop a curiosity about what happens next. 
This curiosity makes you feel to read the book and you don't get bored by it. Basically the book is 
divided into chapters and each one is interconnected by another.
