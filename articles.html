  <b> <span style="font-size: 18px;"><u>Petals of Struggle</u></b></span> <br>by Anny S.<br>
   <span id="dots5"></span><span id="more5">
      I wonder what if we get everything we desire... without struggle, without hard work, without challenges, 
   and without sacrifices; some of us might take it as gold-born great but you would be weak, you won't be able
   to showcase strength when hard times hit, when life disdains and you would be fighting without
   knowing your strength. You won't be able to grow without resistance. If you never had failures,
   disappointments, setbacks, then regret is.. you might never know the true meaning of potential, courage, and 
   compassion because these attributes are fired up when you see through how you grow through the struggle.
   Don't curse the skies if you run into struggling times rather capitalize the opportunity
   to thrive, and inspire others through it. You'll survive whatever is next. Next is a lesson. It'll make you
   stronger, it'll teach you patience, and it'll showcase your spirit. You came with a purpose, you'll find it if 
   you are committed to keep going. It'll all come good by the end and when it does, you won't have just inspired
   yourself, you will have inspired so many others. Your struggle is a chapter of your story. <br>
  <b> Pluck the petals of struggle,<br> The life would envy to blossom you and <br>
   Don't worry, if you pick a thorn;<br> Remember, the thorny stem.. later on<br>
   Produces the most magical roses.</b>

  <b> <span style="font-size: 18px;"><u>The Time I Found The Secret to being Motivated 24x7</u></b></span> 
  <br>by Bhavya Sinha<br>
   <span id="dots7"></span><span id="more7">
   If you are like me, you would have multiple projects running side by side only to be abandoned after 
   a few weeks. Everything seems too exciting but as soon as the excitement fades away, so does your 
   inspiration for pursuing it. I thought I'd never change. But to my surprise I found a way to keep going
   even when I knew that my motivation had run its course. Read on to find out what worked for me and maybe 
   it could work for you too.
<br>Step 1: The very first thing I did upon starting a new project was journal. The motivation right in that 
moment is usually very high. You have all the reasons fresh in your head about why you're doing this. So it 
makes total sense to write down your thoughts either on a piece of paper or online. 
The reason why this helps is that next time when you feel like quitting, instead of spending hours on YouTube
 watching motivational talks, you could read your own thoughts at the time. It will remind you of all the
 reasons you decided to take up this project. After all, no one knows your story, ideas and purpose better
 than you do. And so, the only person to motivate you enough to last till the end, is YOU.
<br>Step 2: Practise consistency everyday. Now I know it seems like a daunting task but let me break it
 down for you. 
When we usually think about consistency, we think of habits such as waking up everyday at 6 am or going to 
the gym every single day. But it doesn't have to be that way. We do not have to associate consistency with 
an everyday practice Or at least, not at the beginning.
For example, If you decide to go for a walk, thrice a week, and follow through, that would be consistency.
 That is only 3 days out of 7 days.
 But if you've ever struggled with self discipline, even 3 days could seem like a burden. So let's break it 
down further.
<br>Step 3: Combine your habit with something that you love
In order to motivate yourself enough to go for that 3 day walk, combine it with something that you love.
 If you like shopping and dressing up, you could go buy some cute sports top or some cool gym pants. 
 Moreover, you could get yourself a nice water bottle and even a sweatband if you'd like. The idea here 
 is that you should have some level of excitement because you have something to look forward to. In our 
 case, here it was new clothes.
Another example could be learning a new instrument. If you want to learn a new instrument but struggle
 to find the energy to start, or even to pick it up after the first class, come up with maybe a reward system,
 like an episode of your favourite show or a glass of your favourite beverage. So as soon as your finish your
 guitar lesson, or practise session, you could reward yourself with some of your favourite shows or with some
 freshly squeezed juice. Talk about a win-win!
So to sum up, write down your thoughts when you are excited about your new habit/project, practise consistency
 in small bits and combine your new habit/project with something that you love.

  <b> <span style="font-size: 18px;"><u>Procrastinating the Procrastination</u></b></span> 
  <br>by Shourya Rohilla<br>
   <span id="dots1"></span><span id="more1">
   The thing about humans is that they want rest. They require rest when they feel they are tired,
   which is no doubt true. But many a times we think we are tired when we have just done a little 
   to no work. And then we take rest. This doesn't help as it becomes a habit. 
Humans may have a lot of abilities in them and being
   lazy is one of them. We take things for granted. And most importantly, we procastinate. 
   "I ll do it by tomorrow morning anyhow." But alas, that tomorrow soon becomes day after and 
   it continues. Later on, the same us are left crying. If you think things are magically gonna 
fall under your arms then you are cheating on yourself. Being lazy becomes a habit and nothing, 
I repeat, nothing in this world is more dangerous than having laziness as your prime habit. 
It devastates everything. So what can we do to erase this habit? Well the answer is so simple
 that it was always there with you. As the cliche saying goes, "Start grinding, start working".
 Make hard work as your habit and trust me once that becomes your habit, you are bound to achieve success.
 It's easier said than done though, no doubt. But who said trying has limited attempts?
Remember, the main problem resides with us. We think we have time, and that's where the problem lies. 
Always tell yourself that you deserve something much bigger than your excuses and laziness. 
After all, you are a precious piece of a human with so much talent in and out.

  <b> <span style="font-size: 18px;"><u>From Closet to Boutique</u></b></span> <br>by Riya Maheshwari<br>
   <span id="dots6"></span><span id="more6">
They say dreams speak through thoughts and action! Wondering how far we can see through,
how far we can grow through, and most importantly how long we can do this. As a kid, from a small closet of 
fashion-apparel and things, right from basics, to hugely
dreamt possibilities to fill in to own a whole fancy boutique, and when we think we could do so; now there 
comes a spark, how if one goes for
it at their very own pace (of course continuous efforts), 'set small steps to reach the bigger ladder', 
then repeat the small steps, 
another bigger ladder, and so on. That's how you define sky is the limit no?
Practice is an art, when done seriously, it earns wonders and miracles, seriously! Now the bigger
picture is the willingness and courage to plan and provide an affordable yet fancy-dreamt closet to everyone.
 Fun and seriousness
are never written together, naah not here! The more fun you have in putting up ideas to spread the affordable 
fancy apparel, the more your heart appreciates it. There will be a lot of trial and error, but we know
tide turns every now and then and saying it for a boutique, it's up to the mark.
 From a small closet to owning a boutique, only extension in ideas, thoughts, the never give up spirit, and
 a kind effort to provide it for everyone out there!
Certainly sounds like that child who dreamt of owning a bigger picture once, is now 
getting into thoughts and action. So yes, they spoke it right, dreams do speak through thoughts and action!

   “The future belongs to those who believe in the beauty of their dreams.” 
– Eleanor Roosevelt <br>
  I have always had a knack for all things creative, be it painting, dancing or cooking! But I found
  my real love for baking in class 12th (Surprising, right?) when I would keep on baking an array 
  of items just to relieve myself from the stressful situation of studying (wicked laugh). I didn’t 
  realize when this ‘baking for time pass’ got converted into my greatest passion till now and how 
  this passion keeps on motivating me to innovate and create new food items each and every day! 
  Even though, I wasn’t able to take this field as my profession, but I did not let that undermine
  my passion and my dreams. It goes without saying that it was (and still is) a difficult task to 
  strike a balance between both the fields, but I strongly believe that If you love something enough
  and are determined to work towards that, you will definitely find out time to do that, and that’s 
  what I did because the joy you get after making a beautiful and delicious piece of food and the 
  pleasure you get when someone tastes it and appreciates it, is beyond imagination! This is what 
  has driven me to achieve my dreams and today, I am a proud owner of small home based dessert business
  and an Instagram blog, working relentlessly to realize my dreams and achieve greater and greater 
  levels of satisfaction and happiness.

  <b> <span style="font-size: 18px;"><u>Embracing Failures</u></b></span> <br>by Raunak Jain<br>
   <span id="dots2"></span><span id="more2">
  In school, Steve Jobs suffered as he had dyslexia. Jobs did not like education from his early days in
  elementary school, where he became dissatisfied with schooling to college, and  dropped out after just
  one semester, because he did not feel that in his life it had practical implications.
But not completing his education did not prevent him from achieving success like becoming the CEO of one 
of the most creative technology firms in the world.Jobs used some of what he learned in school to help him 
create many of his Apple products, but he also used life experience.
Jobs preached that no matter what happens in your life, school failures or a failed career path, any factor
 will help you down the road somehow. "Again, you can't connect the dots looking forward,you can only connect 
 them looking backwards," Jobs said. "So you have to trust that the dots will somehow connect in your future. 
 You have to trust in something—your gut, destiny, life, karma, whatever. This approach has never let me down,
 and it has made all the difference in my life."

  <b> <span style="font-size: 18px;"><u>The Missile Man</u></b></span> <br>by Antriksh Tiwari<br>
   <span id="dots4"></span><span id="more4">

 Known as the Missile Man of India, APJ Abdul Kalam was an Indian scientist and politician who played a
 leading role in the development of India’s-missile and nuclear weapons programs. He was also elected 
 president of India from 2002 to 2007. Kalam was born into a poor Tamil Muslim family on October 15, 1931,
 in the pilgrimage town of Rameswaram, Tamil Nadu. After graduating from the Madras Institute of Technology 
 in 1960, Kalam joined the Aeronautical Development Establishment of the Defence Research and Development
 Organisation as a scientist, after becoming a member of the DRDS.
In 1969, Dr Kalam was transferred andstarted working with the Indian Space Research Organisation.
 The same year Kalam received the government’s approval and expanded the programme to include more 
 engineers. It was in the year 1974, under the supervision of Dr Kalam, India underwent its first nuclear
 test. It was through these nuclear tests he showed the world India’s position and power in nuclear technology.
He was the proud author of numerous inspirational books like India 2010, Ignited Minds, Mission India,
 The Luminous Sparks and Inspiring Thoughts. Kalam was an optimistic person who had a vision of a stronger
 India with a more educated and informed youth. In 1998, made his entry into medical industry along with 
 cardiologist Soma Raju, where Kalam developed a low cost coronary stent, named the Kalam-Raju Stent. 
 Kalam was appointed as Principal Scientific Adviser to the Government of India.
Kalam served as the Chief Scientific Adviser to the Prime Minister and Secretary of the Defence Research 
and Development Organisation from July 1992 to December 1999. Kalam served as the 11th President of India,
 succeeding K. In 1981, The Government of India honoured him with the Padma Bhushan and in 1990, he was
 awarded with another Padma Vibhushan for his work with ISRO and DRDO and his role as a scientific advisor 
 to the Government. In 2012, Kalam was ranked number 2 in Outlook India’s poll of the Greatest Indian. 
 In 1963 to 1964, he visited NASA’s Langley Research Center in Hampton, Virginia, Goddard Space Flight 
 Center in Greenbelt, Maryland and Wallops Flight Facility.
Between the 1970s and 1990s, Kalam made an effort to develop the Polar Satellite Launch Vehicle and SLV-III
 projects, both of which proved to be successful. In May 2012, Kalam launched a programme for the youth of 
 India called the What Can I Give Movement, with a central theme of defeating corruption. Kalam was travelling
 to Shillong to deliver a lecture at the Indian Institute of Management Shillong, however only five minutes
 into his lecture, he collapsed. Despite being placed in the intensive care unit, Kalam was confirmed dead 
 of a sudden cardiac arrest.
His last words, to his aide Srijan Pal Singh, were reportedly- Funny guy! Are you doing well? Following his
 death, Kalam received numerous tributes. The Tamil Nadu state government announced that his birthday, 
 15 October, would be observed across the state as Youth Renaissance Day , the state government further 
 instituted the Dr. Abdul Kalam Award, constituting an 8-gram gold medal, a certificate and ₹500,000. 
 In his book India 2020, Kalam strongly advocated an action plan to develop India into a knowledge 
 superpower and a developed nation by the year 2020.
He regarded his work on India’s nuclear weapons programme as a way to assert India’s place as a future superpower.

  <b> <span style="font-size: 18px;"><u>The Hand The Rocks The Cradle Rules The World
  </u></b></span> <br>by Aashray Mody<br>
   <span id="dots8"></span><span id="more8">
   When a person imagines what rules the world it’s the next nuclear power the next world power, but all 
   of this seems frail when your mother acts as a force of change. 
I was previously ashamed to admit that despite being a single child from a single mother I never appreciated 
the joys of it. An emotional roller-coaster from thinking why as a child my dad didn’t want my custody always 
in the back of mind to growing up and never understanding it.   
I always knew it’s a good habit to be content to in what I have. I have never been averse to my mom or any 
ungratefulness towards her. I would not be able speak up in anywhere, whenever a question be raised such as 
“where is your dad” , or “why has your mom only come”. Truthfully speaking it was hard , sometimes in the lone 
corners a slight tear would roll down my cheek thinking that whether I will be ever be able to answer with confidence. 
As it has been said fortunes does favour the brave, I am grateful to be under the tutelage of my  schoolteacher 
Patrick sir who helped me conquer all my fears. By listening to him and hearing from the first time that he 
too had a similar childhood story like mine. Some of the points he said may sound very general however they 
really helped me. 
<br>Your mom was a fighter she fought for your custody she really loved you. So, what if you are a single 
child that should not only increase your confidence but should have a sense of pride. You are your mothers’ 
vision since she is a fighter and that spirit is embodied in you. 
I would just like to conclude that yes, I have had my  downs but yes being a single child is a huge blessing 
which I feel sheepish in saying that I realised late.
