   <span id="dots5"></span><span id="more5">
   lazy is one of them. We take things for granted. And most importantly, we procastinate. 
   "I ll do it by tomorrow morning anyhow." But alas, that tomorrow soon becomes day after and 
   it continues. Later on, the same us are left crying. If you think things are magically gonna 
fall under your arms then you are cheating on yourself. Being lazy becomes a habit and nothing, 
I repeat, nothing in this world is more dangerous than having laziness as your prime habit. 
It devastates everything. So what can we do to erase this habit? Well the answer is so simple
 that it was always there with you. As the cliche saying goes, "Start grinding, start working".
 Make hard work as your habit and trust me once that becomes your habit, you are bound to achieve success.
 It's easier said than done though, no doubt. But who said trying has limited attempts?
Remember, the main problem resides with us. We think we have time, and that's where the problem lies. 
Always tell yourself that you deserve something much bigger than your excuses and laziness. 
After all, you are a precious piece of a human with so much talent in and out.

  <br>Article by Shourya Rohilla</b><br>
   <span id="dots1"></span><span id="more1">
   <span style="text-align: justify;">
   The thing about humans is that they want rest. They require rest when they feel they are tired,
   which is no doubt true. But many a times we think we are tired when we have just done a little 
   to no work. And then we take rest. This doesn't help as it becomes a habit. 
Humans may have a lot of abilities in them and being
   lazy is one of them. We take things for granted. And most importantly, we procastinate. 
   "I ll do it by tomorrow morning anyhow." But alas, that tomorrow soon becomes day after and 
   it continues. Later on, the same us are left crying. If you think things are magically gonna

  <b> <span style="font-size: 18px;"><u>Embracing Failures</u></span> <br>Article by Raunak Jain</b><br>
   <span id="dots2"></span><span id="more2">
  In school, Steve Jobs suffered as he had dyslexia. Jobs did not like education from his early days in
  elementary school, where he became dissatisfied with schooling to college, and  dropped out after just
  one semester, because he did not feel that in his life it had practical implications.
But not completing his education did not prevent him from achieving success like becoming the CEO of one 
of the most creative technology firms in the world.Jobs used some of what he learned in school to help him 
create many of his Apple products, but he also used life experience.
Jobs preached that no matter what happens in your life, school failures or a failed career path, any factor
 will help you down the road somehow. "Again, you can't connect the dots looking forward,you can only connect 
 them looking backwards," Jobs said. "So you have to trust that the dots will somehow connect in your future. 
 You have to trust in somethingâ€”your gut, destiny, life, karma, whatever. This approach has never let me down,
 and it has made all the difference in my life."
